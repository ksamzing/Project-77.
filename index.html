        <h1>Visual Studio</h1>
        <br>
        <p style="font-family:cursive;">Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft. It is used 
            to develop computer programs, as well as websites, web apps, web services and mobile apps. Visual
             Studio uses Microsoft software development platforms such as Windows API, Windows Forms, Windows
              Presentation Foundation, Windows Store and Microsoft Silverlight. It can produce both native code 
              and managed code.</p>
              <br>
              <p style="font-family:cursive;" >
            Visual Studio includes a code editor supporting IntelliSense (the code completion component) as 
            well as code refactoring. The integrated debugger works both as a source-level debugger and a 
            machine-level debugger. Other built-in tools include a code profiler, designer for building GUI 
            applications, web designer, class designer, and database schema designer. It accepts plug-ins 
            that expand the functionality at almost every levelâ€”including adding support for source control
             systems (like Subversion and Git) and adding new toolsets like editors and visual designers for 
             domain-specific languages or toolsets for other aspects of the software development lifecycle 
             (like the Azure DevOps client: Team Explorer).
